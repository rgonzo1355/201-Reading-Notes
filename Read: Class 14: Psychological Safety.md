# 1. Three Big Things that Make Teams Feel Safe Together

According to the Google article, in teams where everyone feels safe, three essential things are happening:

- **Talking Freely:** Teammates can say what's on their minds without worrying about getting into trouble. They share ideas and concerns without fear.

- **Caring About Each Other:** Team members understand and care about each other's feelings. They create a supportive atmosphere where everyone feels valued.

- **Everyone Gets a Say:** Everyone has a chance to speak up in these teams. No one feels left out, and different points of view are welcome.

# 2. Evaluation of Psychological Safety in a Previous Professional Setting

Let's look at my experience in a military setting. Communication was structured in a team with a robust chain of command, and everyone knew their role. This created a sense of safety because leaders made decisions, and there was a clear order for everyone to follow. However, this structure could sometimes stifle open discussion, as lower-ranked individuals might need more time to share their opinions openly due to the strict hierarchy.

# 3. Impact of Teams with High Psychological Safety on Company and Team Members

Teams that feel safe can make a big difference:

- **More Great Ideas:** People feel free to share new and cool ideas without worrying about being shut down. This helps the team come up with creative solutions.

- **Better Teamwork:** When everyone trusts each other, working together becomes smoother. The team can solve problems and make decisions more effectively.

- **Happier People:** Feeling safe at work makes people more comfortable and less stressed. It makes the job more enjoyable and helps everyone get along better.

- **Getting More Done:** Safe teams are usually more productive. Good communication and support from teammates motivate everyone to work harder.

- **People Stick Around:** When a workplace feels safe, people are likelier to stay. This saves the company from having to find and train new employees.
